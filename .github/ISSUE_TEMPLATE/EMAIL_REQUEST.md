# Welcome!

Thanks for your interest in adding a letter to represent your city. Due to the high volume of requests, the moderators need emails to follow some guidelines so that we can review them effectively. If you don't follow the below guidelines, your letter may not be added! Some submissions may undergo minor editing/cleanups. If the published content does not accurately reflect your original intent/voice, please open another request.

## Template Requirements

- Email addresses of the government officials you’d like to receive the message. Typically the city council and mayor decide the city budget, so all of them are a great start.
- Firm, actionable, focused message.

## Content

- We are amplifying calls to defund the police, not reform them. Demands for reforms (e.g., policing tactics and training) will be removed.
- Make the email specific to your city/county. Some ideas:
    - How much of the budget (in $ or %) goes to the police, in comparison to other programs?
    - Recent events or issues in your city that highlight the flaws of your police department?
- Avoid the police narrative of "crime": Speak in terms of “promoting community safety” rather than “reducing crime.”

## Format and Style

- Avoid referring to the email sender as a "citizen" or "voter". Not all senders may be citizens or voters.
- Use first-person (e.g., “I demand…” not “We demand…”).
