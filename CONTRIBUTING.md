Do you want to help with the project? Awesome! We can definitely use it. This project started off as the work of a single person but has exploded in several days to encompass a distributed team of volunteers all around the country (and maybe world?). We are still trying to figure out the best processes, it's a bit hectic!

Check out the possible ways in which you could help below:

## Writing emails (non-technical)

If there is no email yet for your city, it would be awesome if you wrote one! See [the writing guide](docs/email_writing.md) for more info.

## Reviewing emails (non-technical)

This is where we need the most help. When emails are first written, they need to be fact-checked and lightly edited for typos.  See [the reviewing guide](docs/email_reviewing.md) for more info.

## Formatting emails (semi-technical)

After proposed emails have been reviewed, they need to be formatted and added to the website. See [the formatting guide](docs/email_formatting.md) for more info.

## Other (non-technical to technical)

There are plenty of other things that we could use your help with. This could be reviewing already submitted emails to ensure they are quality, writing code for the website, mentoring other volunteers, doing social media outreach, or something else. Introduce yourself on the [#general channel of our Discord](https://discord.gg/epwskWD) and we can find you something!
