  Dear Mayor Haskew and City Council Members,

  My name is \[YOUR NAME\] and I am a Walnut Creek resident writing to urge you to defund the Walnut Creek Police Department.

  The Walnut Creek Police Department takes up 30% ($52.1M) of the city’s general fund. This percentage has risen for the last two decades and takes away desperately needed resources from essential city programs and services. The entire budget for Community & Economic Development only accounts for 8% ($14.9M) of the city's budget. Increased police spending shows no correlation to increasing public safety over the past 20 years, thus our city's investment in policing has not made us safer – WCPD remains an embarrassment to the city and a lethal threat to Walnut Creek's Black and Brown communities.  With Walnut Creek's current finances in dire jeopardy, it is clear that we must defund the police.

  As a Walnut Creek resident, I therefore demand that you take immediate action to ensure the following:

  * Reduce WCPD’s allocation from the General Fund by 50% (roughly $26M).

  * Disallow unauthorised overtime by WCPD.

  * Discontinue use of general fund dollars to pay for settlements due to police murder, misconduct, and negligence.

  * Invest in housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice, and mental health workers to keep the community safe.

  Walnut Creek can not wait any longer for a budget that meets the needs of its residents. The only way to achieve this is to take immediate steps to Defund and Abolish WCPD.

  Thank you,
