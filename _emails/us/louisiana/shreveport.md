  Dear Shreveport City Council, staff, and Executive departments

  My name is \[YOUR NAME\]. I am a Shreveport resident writing to urge you to defund the City of Shreveport Police Department.

  I am contacting you to demand a significant reduction to the $60,588,900 million that is currently allocated to funding the Shreveport Police department and for a formal review of the Shreveport Police Department Union Contract \[1\]. The police funds make up roughly 28% of the budget, while other important public services such as Community Development which should cover social programs and outreach receives only 10%, and property standards receive less than 2% \[1\]. By defunding the police, those funds can be re-allocated to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, an improved aging infrastructure, and more. By defunding the police, we can focus on building our community efforts and local organizations, while preventing future police brutality and violence.

  As a Shreveport resident, I therefore demand that you take immediate action towards the following ends:

  * Reduce SPDâ€™s allocation from the General Fund.

  * Discontinue use of General Fund dollars to pay for settlements due to police murder, misconduct, and negligence.

  * Invest in housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice, and mental health workers to keep the community safe.

  Shreveport can not wait any longer for a budget that meets the needs of its residents. The only way to achieve this is to take immediate steps to Defund SPD.

  Sincerely,

  \[YOUR NAME\]
  \[YOUR ADDRESS\]
  \[YOUR EMAIL\]
  \[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\]
